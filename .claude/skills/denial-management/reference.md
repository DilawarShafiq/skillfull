# Denial Management Skill

## Overview
This skill covers the identification, analysis, appeal, and prevention of claim denials to maximize revenue recovery for US healthcare providers.

## Key Competencies

### Denial Identification and Categorization

#### Denial Types
- **Hard Denials**: Cannot be corrected; must appeal or write off
- **Soft Denials**: Can be corrected and resubmitted
- **Clinical Denials**: Medical necessity, level of care
- **Technical/Administrative Denials**: Missing info, coding errors

#### Common Denial Categories
| Category | Examples | Action |
|----------|----------|--------|
| Eligibility | Coverage terminated, not covered | Verify/bill patient |
| Authorization | No auth, invalid auth | Appeal with clinical docs |
| Coding | Invalid code, unbundling | Correct and resubmit |
| Duplicate | Already processed | Verify original payment |
| Timely Filing | Past deadline | Appeal if proof of timely submission |
| Medical Necessity | LCD/NCD not met | Appeal with documentation |

### Denial Reason Codes

#### Most Common CARCs
- CO-4: Procedure code inconsistent with modifier
- CO-11: Diagnosis inconsistent with procedure
- CO-16: Claim lacks information
- CO-18: Duplicate claim
- CO-22: Coordination of benefits
- CO-27: Expenses after coverage terminated
- CO-29: Time limit for filing expired
- CO-45: Exceeds fee schedule
- CO-50: Non-covered service
- CO-96: Non-covered charge
- CO-97: Bundled service
- CO-109: Not covered by this payer
- CO-167: Diagnosis not covered
- CO-197: Authorization not obtained

### Appeal Process

#### Appeal Levels
1. **First Level**: Internal payer review
2. **Second Level**: Payer medical director review
3. **Third Level**: External/Independent review
4. **Fourth Level**: State insurance commissioner/CMS

#### Appeal Letter Components
- Patient and claim identification
- Date of service and provider information
- Denial reason being appealed

#### Appeal Deadlines
| Payer Type | Typical Deadline |
|------------|------------------|
