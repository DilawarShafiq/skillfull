# Medical Coding Reference Guide

## ICD-10-CM Coding Guidelines

### Sequencing Rules
- Principal diagnosis: Condition established after study as chiefly responsible for admission
- Secondary diagnoses: Conditions that affect patient care
- Code to highest specificity available

### Placeholder X
Use 'X' as placeholder when:
- 7th character required but fewer than 6 characters
- Example: T36.0X1A (Poisoning by penicillins, accidental, initial encounter)

### 7th Character Extensions
- A = Initial encounter
- D = Subsequent encounter
- S = Sequela

### Excludes Notes
- **Excludes1**: Never code both codes together
- **Excludes2**: Not included here; may code both if documented

| Low | 2+ minor or 1 chronic stable | Limited | Low |
| Moderate | 1+ chronic with exacerbation | Moderate | Moderate |
| High | 1+ chronic illness with severe exacerbation | Extensive | High |

### Time-Based Coding
