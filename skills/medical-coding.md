# Medical Coding Skill

## Overview
This skill covers the assignment of standardized codes (ICD-10-CM/PCS, CPT, HCPCS) to diagnoses and procedures for US healthcare billing and reporting.

## Key Competencies

### ICD-10-CM Diagnosis Coding
- Code to highest level of specificity
- Apply official coding guidelines
- Sequence diagnoses correctly (principal vs secondary)
- Use combination codes when available
- Apply excludes notes (Excludes1, Excludes2)
- Use placeholder "X" appropriately
- Apply 7th character extensions

### ICD-10-PCS Procedure Coding (Inpatient)
- Understand 7-character structure
- Apply root operation definitions
- Select correct body part values
- Identify approach and device
- Code multiple procedures appropriately

### CPT Coding
- Evaluation & Management (E/M) coding
  - 2021 E/M guidelines for office visits
  - Medical Decision Making (MDM) levels
  - Time-based coding rules
- Surgery coding
  - Global surgical packages
  - Modifier usage (-59, -25, -26, -TC, etc.)
  - Multiple procedure rules
- Medicine section procedures
- Radiology coding
- Pathology and laboratory coding

### HCPCS Level II Coding
- Durable Medical Equipment (DME)
- Drugs and biologicals (J-codes)
- Ambulance services
- Temporary codes
- Medicare-specific codes

### Modifier Application
| Modifier | Description | Common Use |
|----------|-------------|------------|
| -25 | Significant, separately identifiable E/M | E/M with procedure same day |
| -59 | Distinct procedural service | Unbundling when appropriate |
| -26 | Professional component | Physician interpretation |
| -TC | Technical component | Facility component |
| -76 | Repeat procedure, same physician | Same procedure, same day |
| -77 | Repeat procedure, different physician | Same procedure, different MD |
| -LT/-RT | Left side / Right side | Bilateral procedures |
| -50 | Bilateral procedure | Both sides, single code |

## Coding Compliance

### National Correct Coding Initiative (NCCI)
- Column 1/Column 2 edits
- Mutually Exclusive edits
- Medically Unlikely Edits (MUEs)
- Modifier indicators

### Coding for Medical Necessity
- Link diagnosis to procedure
- Support with clinical documentation
- Apply Local Coverage Determinations (LCDs)
- Apply National Coverage Determinations (NCDs)

## Specialty-Specific Coding
- Cardiology (93000 series)
- Orthopedics (20000-29999)
- OB/GYN (59000 series)
- Behavioral Health (90791-90899)
- Dermatology (11000-11999)
- Ophthalmology (65000-68999, 92000 series)

## Coding Resources
- AMA CPT Manual
- ICD-10-CM/PCS Official Guidelines
- CMS NCCI Policy Manual
- LCD/NCD databases
- Encoder software (3M, Optum, etc.)
- AHA Coding Clinic

## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
- Coding accuracy rate (target: >95%)
- Coding productivity (charts per hour)
- Code denial rate
- Query response rate
- Unbilled/uncoded accounts

## Certification Requirements
- CPC (Certified Professional Coder) - AAPC
- CCS (Certified Coding Specialist) - AHIMA
- COC (Certified Outpatient Coder) - AAPC
- CIC (Certified Inpatient Coder) - AAPC
- Specialty certifications (CIRCC, CPMA, etc.)

## Annual Updates
- New CPT codes effective January 1
- New ICD-10 codes effective October 1
- HCPCS updates quarterly
- Medicare fee schedule updates annually
- LCD/NCD changes throughout year
